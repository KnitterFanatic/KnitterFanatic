# How to knit

My mom is a crocheter. I on the other hand am not. I absolutely failed at crocheting. There is one thing that I can do though, _knit._ And I want to share that love of knitting with you. The project we will do is knitting a coaster. Nice and simple. 

# Supplies:

- knitting needles (If you are new to knitting I would highly suggest using wood or plastic needles. Medal needles will let your stitches come off easier which when you are new to knitting can be hard because sometimes they will come off when you don't want them too. And I talk from experience here.ðŸ˜„)

- yarn

- scissors

- yarn needle

# Instructions:

## 1. Casting On
In order for you to create your piece of art you have to have the foundation. This is known as casting or binding on. When you are finished you will see loops on your needle. The questions is: how to do that? 

What you want to do is tie your yarn onto your needle using whatever knot you desire. After doing that pick the yarn up in your left hand and make a loop with it. Put your needle through the bottom of the loop. Continue this until you have **20 stitches/loops.**

## 2. Knitting the knit stitch
This is the most basic knitting stitch. It is also the foundation of knitting. So, how do we do it? 

In your left hand take the needle that has the 20 stitches on it. Pick the other needle up in your right hand. Put your needle through the bottom of the first loop on the needle. Then wrap the yarn around counter-clockwise, and pull it through the loop. Drop the first stitch off the left hand needle. **Only the FIRST stitch!** Now you have completed a knitt stitch! Continue doing this for the entire row. To do the next row take the needle with all the stitches on it and put it in your left hand and start all over again. Continue until your coaster is the size you want it to be. 

## 3. Casting Off
You are close to the finish line. But there is still a little bit left to do. Of course we don't want to pull our stitches off and make our coaster unravel. We want it to be in one piece. To do that we do what we call casting or binding off. 

To bind off knit two stitches like regular. Then put your needle in the top of the first stitch that you knitted on the right hand needle. Slip that over the first stitch and off the needle. Continue this until you have only _one_ stitch remaining. Cut the yarn about six inches long. Then take the stitch off the needle and put the yarn through it. Pull it tight. 

## 4. Weaving in the ends
One _small_ thing left to do. Weave in the ends. You will notice that there are strings dangling from where you began and ended. You need to use that yarn needle and weave them into your knitting. Try to make it where you can't see were you wove the ends in. 

**Congratulations you have just knitted!**

I hope you had fun doing this project.
